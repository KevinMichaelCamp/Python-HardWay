# Create clockHandAngles(seconds) that, given a number of seconds since 12:00:00, prints angles (in degrees) of the hour, minute and second hands. As review, 360 degrees form a full rotation. For an input of 3600 secs (equivalent to 1 hr) print "Hour hand: 30 degs. Minute Hand: 0 degs. Second Hand: 0degs."
